•	Why are we doing this?


•	How I expected the challenge to go.


•	What went well?


•	What didn't go as planned?


<b> •	Possible improvements for future : </b> <br>
Adding input validations through private boolean functions to restrict sales reports to only named products. Allowing for the forms to retain knwoledge of compliant inputs where the exceptions on the trys are triggered. Currently fo instance, entering the wrong data type for price will reset the entry sale input screen and retain no knowledge of previous entries. 
<br> <br>
More widely, making the prices feed automatically through an array pre-loaded into the C# or a second table in the SQL Database. Likewise adding functionality to allow for variations to products across sizing, prices, discounts etc. Finally, most sales are not exclusively one single product so adding functionality to allow a single sale to include multiple different products.
